AMIDSTforClimateControl
=======================

The AMIDST program modified for Climate Control

This is the source code for a modified version of AMIDST. When run, it shows the world as it would be produced by
Climate Control 0.2 with that seed using the default settings. Settings are hardcoded and can be changed by editing
climateControl.ClimateControlSettings.java and recompiling. The AMIDST program requires a lot of libraries and they 
will all need to be installed to recompile.
